//        Replace "vendor_id" and "product_id" with the USB vendor ID and product ID of your printer, respectively. You can find these IDs by running the following command in a terminal window:


//        Look for your printer in the list of connected USB devices, and note down the vendor ID and product ID.
//
//    With this updated method, you should be able to print directly to your USB-connected POS printer from your Laravel application.

//I apologize for the confusion. The lsusb command is specific to Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. If you are running your Laravel application on a Windows machine, you can try the following steps to find the vendor ID and product ID of your USB printer:
//
//Connect your USB printer to your computer.
//
//Open the Windows Device Manager. You can do this by right-clicking on the Start menu and selecting "Device Manager" from the menu.
//
//Expand the "Printers" section of the Device Manager.
//
//Find your USB printer in the list of printers, and double-click on it to open its properties.
//
//In the printer properties window, go to the "Details" tab.
//
//In the "Property" dropdown list, select "Hardware Ids".
//
//The "Value" field will display the vendor ID and product ID of your printer in the following format:
//
//USB\VID_xxxx&PID_xxxx
//
//The four-digit values after "VID_" and "PID_" are the vendor ID and product ID, respectively.
//
//Once you have obtained the vendor ID and product ID of your USB printer, you can use them to instantiate the UsbPrintConnector class in your Laravel application, as shown in the previous example.
